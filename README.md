# Black-and-White
This is a project that generates black and white tile art as potential poster ideas for my bleak, sterile white room. I decided one day that I wanted to have nice things on my walls and I decided to write this program to help me decide what kinds of things to put on my wall. This is only one idea of many designs.

Black and white grid poster generation in an abstract-ish style from images that I made in MS Paint.

directories named "info" inside of image packs are ignored (hardcoded because I said so :sunglasses:)



TODO for future: 
make nice algorithm that groups together tiles that go together (random doesn't look as good)
